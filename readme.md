Description

## Implementation

## What Makes this a Game?

competence: By clearing all enemies and asteriods you can achieve higher scores.

automy: I attempted to achieve this by letting the player select what missions they decided to go on. I don't force any one path, while a basic path is attempted to be reccomended (the level order being the order of the planets) but realistically you could do it however youd like.

relatedness: While this game may not have the deepest story ever conseieved, I wanted to have some kind of enemy/faction and some simple back story elements to make it more than just "fly around and complete xyz". While with more time (and resources) I may have tried to achieve a more story oriented setting however I feel like there is enough there to make you understand why you may play the game and do what you do.
